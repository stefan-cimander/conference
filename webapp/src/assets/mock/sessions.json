The data for analytics is as current as of the last ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) job that moved data from the operational system to the data warehouse, and business can no longer afford missing on real-time insights on the data that is fresh in the operational system. For example, a retail store could run analytics on transactional data to track sales and use the information to offer discounts. There is an increasing demand for database management systems to be able to perform real-time analytics on data that gets ingested and modified in live mainstream operational databases. As a response, many commercial vendors as well as academia have attempted to solve the problem by combining transactional and analytical processing capabilities in the same database system; these systems will be referred to as operational analytics systems. In this tutorial, we shall present an in-depth overview of operational analytical systems. We shall start with a discussion on the various aspects associated with the design of such a system; ranging from data storage, indexing to query optimization and processing. We shall then present a set of representative systems in detail, highlight their individual architecture and design characteristics, and discuss several key research problems they address. This tutorial is intended for both researchers and practitioners in the industry.","tag":"Tutorial T2"},"roomName":"Maple","startTime":"2016-12-24T10:00:00+01:00","endTime":"2016-12-24T10:15:00+01:00","duration":15,"maxSize":null,"kind":null,"favored":true},
